    <h1>Hi!</h1>
    <h2>I am Luis Mart&iacute;nez Su&aacute;rez.</h2>

		<p>At age 34 I decided to become a web professional.</p>
		
		<p>I currently work in Amsterdam with VueJS, a very easy to use and learn JavaScript framework.</p>

		<p>I have also done some things with React, all of them are showcased either in my <a href="https://github.com/luismartinezs" alt="Github profile Luis Martinez">Github</a> or on <a href="https://codepen.io/luis-martinez-s/" alt="codepen profile Luis Martinez">Codepen</a>. I work with HTML5, CSS3, SCSS and Bootstrap 4. Right now, I am learning NodeJS, serverless and using the Trello API.</p>

    <p>
			Other things I have done in past lives:

      As a little kid I loved drawing.

      I tried a

      related to illustration that sadly never really took off, and also worked
      in a digital agency for a couple of years as a Project Manager. I liked
      the whole tech/web world (what's not to like!), but the role of project
      manager was not too fulfilling to me. I am the guy who wants to dirty his
      hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eventually, I realized that I was heading toward a professional dead end.
      So I decided to act. I've always had the "gusanillo" to learn programming,
      as we say in Spanish. After a brief market analysis (very brief, like 1
      hour), it became very obvious to me that it was a very good idea. In
      August of 2018, after flirting briefly with Java, I went full immersion
      into the web stack. I learned all the usual suspects (html, css,
      javascript) plus React. Happily, I got a job in Amsterdam 4 or 5 months
      later as a front end developer, and things couldn't be better so far.
    </p>

    <p>
      Besides programming, some things I do in my free time are playing
      videogames (in particular,

        >FromSoftware games</a
      >), hacking down things from my to do list, studying programming stuff,
      following the

      and

    </p>

    <p>
      My secret regret is not having started learning the web stack 10 years
      ago.
